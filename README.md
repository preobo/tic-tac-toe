# tic-tac-toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game with a GUI Interface
This project tasks you with developing a two-player Tic Tac Toe game with a GUI interface using 
Java Swing or JavaFX or your preference. The game will showcase solid object-oriented design 
principles including abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, along with 
exception handling and a clean separation of concerns using the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
design pattern.
Players take turns clicking on a 3x3 grid to place their mark (X or O). The GUI updates the board after 
each move and announces the result when there's a win or a draw.
